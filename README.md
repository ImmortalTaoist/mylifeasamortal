**A personal blog and digital notebook — exploring thoughts, experiences, and reflections on life as a mortal being.**

## 🧭 About the Project

**My Life A Mortal** is more than just a blog — it’s a living archive of ideas, stories, and lessons gathered throughout the ongoing journey of being human.  

This repository exists for:
- Sharing the technical setup of my blog (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)  
- Demonstrating how personal blogs can be designed and maintained openly  
- Inspiring others to build, write, and express themselves online  
- Preserving my creative work in a transparent, public space  

The **blog content** you’ll find here — such as posts, essays, and imagery — belongs to me and reflects personal expression.  
Please respect that distinction between **open code** and **protected content**.
